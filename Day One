<h1>The Ball</h1>
<p>My earliest soccer memory dates back to when I was probably 3 or 4 years old. We lived in the countryside of a small town in rural Indiana. We had a large front yard, and I was kicking around one of those little balls that you get for little kids that have silly prints on them. Mine had a soccer ball print, classic white and black. It was a sunny day, and dad had just pulled up in the driveway. I was excited to greet him, say hi, show him what I was doing. So I kicked my ball at his car. As chance would have it, my ball rolled under the car and my dad ran it over. Sorry dad, I'm not mad.</p>
